## About this repository
Home-care is a simple react application that provides an overview of observations
between caregivers and **care recipients** (older adults). ([HERE](https://home-care-report.herokuapp.com/) is a link to the demo version
)

These could be anything from the recording of their mood (happy, sad, bored, confused) to what they drank today (1 pint of water).

Each of these observations are recorded as events. Here's an example of a mood observation recorded
in this event format:

``` json
{  
   "id":"decaa026-2ce5-49cb-aff9-92326b85a98c",
   "event_type":"mood_observation",
   "visit_id":"39b94aab-cc35-4874-807f-c23472aec663",
   "timestamp":"2019-04-23T10:53:13+01:00",
   "caregiver_id":"4786d616-259e-4d52-80f7-8cf7dc6d881a",
   "care_recipient_id":"03f3306d-a4a3-4179-ab88-81af66df8b7c",
   "mood":"okay",
},
```

Here's a quick explanation of the base properties:

- `id`: Uniquely identifies the observation.
- `event_type`: Title we use to categorise our events.
- `visit_id`: Observations are traditionally observed during a visit between the caregiver (carer) and care recipient. This ID identifies that visit.
- `caregiver_id`: Identifies who the caregiver (carer) was that made this observation.
- `care_recipient_id`: Identifies the care recipient this observation is for.

On top of that, there can be **additional properties** based on the `event_type`:

- `mood` describes the mood of the care recipient as reported by the caregiver
